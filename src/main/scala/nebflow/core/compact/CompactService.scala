 * Inline context compaction — reuses the agent's own LLM call with cached
 * system prompt and tool definitions.  No separate LLM request is needed;
 * instead a "compact reminder" is injected as a User message, tools are
 * disabled (tools = Nil), and the streaming response is captured as the
 * summary.
 *
 * Benefits over the old approach:
 *   - Cache hit on system prompt + tool definitions (huge token savings)
 *   - No message pre-processing / truncation / rebuilding
 *   - Response streams to the frontend (user sees progress)
 *   - Simpler code path

      |CRITICAL INSTRUCTION — CONTEXT COMPACTION REQUIRED.
      |Your conversation context has grown too large and must be compressed.
      |
      |Stop your current task immediately. All tools have been DISABLED for this turn.
      |You MUST respond with TEXT ONLY — do NOT call any tools.
      |
      |Your entire response must contain exactly two blocks:
      |
      |1. An <analysis> block where you organize your thoughts about the conversation.
      |2. A <summary> block with the following sections:
      |
      |<summary>
      |1. Primary Request and Intent:
      |   [Detailed description of all the user's explicit requests and intents]
      |
      |2. Key Technical Concepts:
      |   - [Concept 1]
      |   - [Concept 2]
      |
      |3. Files and Code Sections:
      |   Each file with its path in backticks, line ranges, and what was found/changed.
      |   - `path/to/file` (line 42-89): description
      |     ```
      |     key code snippet
      |     ```
      |
      |4. Errors and Fixes:
      |   - [Detailed description of error]: [How you fixed it]
      |
      |5. Problem Solving:
      |   [Description of solved problems and ongoing troubleshooting efforts]
      |
      |6. All User Messages:
      |   - [Detailed non-tool-use user message]
      |
      |7. Pending Tasks:
      |   - [Task 1]
      |
      |8. Current Work:
      |   [Precise description of what was being worked on immediately before this summary request.]
      |
      |9. Optional Next Step:
      |   [The single immediate next action. Include direct quotes from the most recent conversation.]
      |</summary>
      |
      |After the </summary> tag, list files whose content should be restored after compaction.
      |These should be files you are actively reading, editing, or will need immediately.
      |Maximum 5 files.
      |
      |<files>
      |path/to/file1
      |path/to/file2
      |</files>
      |
      |Rules:
      |- Preserve file paths with backticks, always include line numbers when known
      |- Be specific, not vague
      |- Preserve all decisions, trade-offs, and user preferences stated
      |- If the user gave explicit instructions, quote them verbatim
      |- Keep the summary focused and information-dense
      |- Write the summary in the SAME language as the user's messages
      |</system-reminder>""".stripMargin
